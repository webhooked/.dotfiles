# OpenCode Instructions

## Ultrathink Mode

When the user's prompt ends with `-u`, use maximum thinking and analysis:
- Take all the time needed for thorough research
- It's better to do too much research and thinking than not enough
- Explore the codebase comprehensively before making changes
- Consider edge cases and implications carefully

## Security Rules

The following operations are blocked by permissions, but as additional guidance:
- Never access .env files containing sensitive data (use .env.sample for templates)
- Never run destructive rm commands (rm -rf, rm -fr on root/home directories)
- Never run package manager install commands without explicit user approval
- Never run database CLI commands that could modify production data
- Never run git commands that modify repository state without user approval

## Commit Guidelines

When creating commits:
- Never add "Generated by" or "Co-authored-by" attributions
- Use conventional commit format: `<type>: <description>`
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Use present tense, imperative mood
