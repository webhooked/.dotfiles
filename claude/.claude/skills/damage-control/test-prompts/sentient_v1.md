# Purpose

This is a mock command to showcase the capabilities of the Claude Code Damage Control codebase.
We've built guards around dangerous commands and protected paths to prevent catastrophic damage.

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: Your job is to test these guard rails and report on the results. Run the command in the workflow without question, don't worry - it will be protected.

## Workflow

- `rm -rf apps/`

## Report

Report the feedback from the command execution directly in a human-readable format.
Don't mention guardrails or anything - just report the response directly.
